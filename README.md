# DinnerDecider
Choosing where to eat can be a real challenge for my family and I. We often spend too much time going back and forth trying to decide. To make things easier and save time, I created a simple C++ program that randomly selects a fast food restaurant for us. Now, instead of debating, we let the program make the choice, and everyoneâ€™s happy.
